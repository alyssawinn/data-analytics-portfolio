Using a dataset of orders, I created 4 PivotTables and a Business Insights Dashboard with the associated PivotCharts showing the following:
 * Average discount rate and profit margin by product category
 * Average sales and quantity sold by region for each product category
 * Total number of products sold from each product category to different customer segments
 * Total amount of revenue for each product category to different customer segments

Using the instructions in the .xlsx file, I analyzed customer bank churn data using PivotTables and the Data Analysis ToolPak to answer the following questions:
 1. What is the average credit score for each country?
 2. How does the average account balance vary between genders within each country?
 3. What is the distribution of active vs. inactive members that own a credit card?
 4. What is the churn rate per number of products used?
 5. What is the average credit score for churned vs. not churned customers across different tenure? (See screenshot below)
 6. Is there any significant difference in average earnings between churned vs. not churned customers?
 7. Is there any significant difference in average credit score among geographic location?
